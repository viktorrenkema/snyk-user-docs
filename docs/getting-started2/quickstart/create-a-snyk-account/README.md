# Create a Snyk account

You need a Snyk account to use Snyk functions.

If you already have a Snyk account, see [Logging in to an existing account](logging-in-to-an-existing-account.md).
{% endhint %}

To create a Snyk account:

1.  Go to [https://snyk.io/](https://snyk.io) and click **Start free** on the left of the page, or **Sign up**.

### **What's next?**

To scan your code, you must first integrate Snyk with the repository holding that code, either:

* Following the automated prompts, immediately after creating a Snyk account.
* Manually, at any time.

See [Set up an integration](../set-up-an-integration.md) for details.
