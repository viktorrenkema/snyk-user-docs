# Logging in to an existing account

You can navigate to [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and use the link to log in. If your company uses single sign-on (SSO), use the SSO link provided by your administrators.

If your company requires an invitation to use Snyk, you may see a list of Organizations when you log in for the first time. This means that you have not yet been invited. Select the name of an Organization Admin to send an email to request access to that Organization.

Organizations in Snyk control access to projects. For details see the [Snyk Organizations](../../../snyk-admin/manage-groups-and-organizations/whats-a-snyk-organization.md) page.

The Organization settings and policies influence your scan results, depending on which Organization you use when you add a project.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you log in with a different authentication provider from the one your company uses for the Snyk account, you create a new account. You will not be logged in to the correct Organization for your company.
{% endhint %}

Snyk shows your preferred (or default) Organization when you log in to the Snyk Web UI. Snyk also uses the settings for your preferred Organization when you test a project locally using the CLI.

{% hint style="info" %}
To change your default Organization, see [Manage account preferences and settings](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-web-ui/getting-started-with-the-snyk-web-ui#manage-account-preferences-and-settings) on Getting started with the Snyk Web UI.
