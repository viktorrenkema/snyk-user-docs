# Exploring the Snyk Web UI

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have not done so already, you should [create an account](quickstart/create-a-snyk-account/).
{% endhint %}

## Introduction

You can use the Snyk Web UI to run a full set of Snyk functions from your browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also access Snyk functions from the [Snyk CLI](../snyk-cli/), from [within your IDE](../integrations/ide-tools/), and using the [Snyk API](../snyk-api-info/).
{% endhint %}

You can connect your code repositories, then use Snyk to scan and secure your application code, open-source libraries, container registries, and configuration files.

### Explore the Dashboard

When you log in to an existing account, the Web UI opens to the Dashboard, allowing you to view your pending tasks and vulnerable projects, invite team members, and add new Projects.

In the above example, the Snyk dashboard for an Enterprise account shows pending tasks and vulnerable projects.

#### Pending tasks

The **Pending tasks** section shows the next chores to be handled for the Projects in a Snyk Organization. This information includes:

* Pull Requests (PRs) that can be raised to fix vulnerabilities in some of the most vulnerable projects.
* PRs that have already been raised by or through Snyk and are open and awaiting review.

Currently, Snyk tracks and flags PRs in GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket Cloud only, and only for the top-most vulnerable projects. If you use another SCM, **Pending tasks** shows only PRs that can be raised, and not PRs that have already been raised.

#### Add project

Use the **Add project** link on the dashboard to add [Snyk Projects](../manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects/). Select how to add the Project from the dropdown.

Use the links for Projects on the dashboard to explore and manage the metadata, retest, and fix options for the Targetfiles in your Projects. Each link opens a Project details page where you can view the Project **Overview**, or switch to the **History** and **Settings** tabs.

* For Projects with the **Fix vulnerabilities** link, use the link to view Project details with an option to **Open a Fix PR.** Use this option to open a fix PR to implement the upgrades and patches in GitHub that address the issues.
* For Projects with a **View PR** link, use the link to open and view the Snyk-generated PR fixes in GitHub.
